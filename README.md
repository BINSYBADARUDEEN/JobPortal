A website for job consultancies, who will act as an intermediate between Employers and job seekers.
The main focus is for unskilled jobs such as kitchen porters, cleaners etc for small or medium type businesses
  or employers who dont have their own website or recruitment team to hire employees for these kind of unskilled jobs.
The website is designed for job consultancies, where an admin can login to the system to post job details, edit or update the jobs, and delete the jobs.
Here, the employers have no direct interaction with the system, one main point is that, the small or medium business owners or managers may lack the knowledge for 
  using a web application. so the employers will contact the consltancies either through phone call or email and provide their job vaccancies, for which the 
  consultancies will be getting an amount from the employer.
Also jobseekers can register and login to the system and can view the job details. 
As of time limitation, the website is not providing the option to upload cv or cover letter, instead an email id of the employer is given along with job description.
  so that the user can send their cv to this mail id.
