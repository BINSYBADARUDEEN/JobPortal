**JOB PORTAL**
A website for job consultancies, who will act as an intermediate between Employers and job seekers.
The main focus is on unskilled jobs such as kitchen porters, cleaners etc for small or medium type businesses or employers who dont have their own website or recruitment team to hire employees for these kind of unskilled jobs.
The website is designed for job consultancies, where an admin can login to the system to post job details, edit or update the jobs, and delete the jobs.
Here, the employers have no direct interaction with the system, and also the small or medium business owners or managers may lack the knowledge for using a software. So the employers will contact the consltancies either through phone call or email and provide their job vaccancies, for which the 
consultancies can charge an amount from the employer.
Also jobseekers can login to the system and can view the job details. 
As of time limitation, and simplicity the website is not providing the option to upload cv or cover letter, instead an email id of the employer is given along with job description. So that the user can send their cv to this mail id.

  Backend - Node.js is used with CommonJS module

  Database - mysql

  Frontend - html,javascript and css

  Unit testing - using jest

  Deployed in azure virtual machine, with apache2, certbot used for https

Implemented CRUD operation for Jobs.A login page is added. If an admin user is logged in, he can view,create,update or delete jobs. And if a job seeker is logged in, he can view and search for the jobs with title or location.
